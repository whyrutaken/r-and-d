# Bitcoin price prediction

This repo contains the code and report for the 10 ECTS Research and Development course @AU.

The goal of this project was to build different machine learning models to predict the price of Bitcoin. I built five models each of LSTM, CNN, CNN-LSTM, and ConvLSTM and trained them on the university's cloud server on the most recent 4 years of data.

The report is sort of half-assed but I achieved some great results.
