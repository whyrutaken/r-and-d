# Bitcoin price prediction

This repo contains the code and the report for the 10 ECTS Research and Development course @AU. Autumn 2021

The goal of this project was to build different machine learning models to predict the price of Bitcoin and compare them. I built 20 models in total, using LSTM, CNN, CNN-LSTM, and ConvLSTM neural networks, and trained them on the most recent 4 years of min-by-min data using the university's cloud servers.
